An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.

We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.

We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.
