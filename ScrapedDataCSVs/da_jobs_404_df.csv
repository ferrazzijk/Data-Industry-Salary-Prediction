Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting.

Although based out of our Chicago office, our BAs will be on client site up to 4 days a week and therefore need to be flexible to travel.


Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise data from a variety of sources. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.


BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work with other team members on day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.


BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.


BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.


Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated.

The leader in real-time TV ad data and analytics is currently seeking a Data Analyst – BI who will design and develop custom reports for iSpot clients. We are seeking a talent who will share our obsession for data accuracy; someone with an insatiable appetite for learning new things and accomplishing challenging goals in a fast-paced (and not always structured) environment. We are looking for someone that is highly motivated and knows how to get things done quickly and efficiently.

We have a product that is changing how brands, agencies and networks measure and assess the impact of TV advertising campaigns. Our software uses proprietary audio and video analysis to monitor and extract TV commercials, movie trailers and other promotional content from TV. At the same time, our software analyzes consumer interactions with TV ads on the digital screen across search, video and social. Interactions are matched with specific ads and attributed back to airings on TV. Our platform collects and analyzes massive amounts of data in real-time.

This is a rare opportunity to get equity in the early stages of a company with significant early traction and which is run by an experienced team.

Responsibilities:

As a key member of the custom analytics team, you will be responsible for a variety of business-critical work that includes, but not limited to:

 Gathering data from multiple data sources, aggregating and manipulating data for analysis, performing analysis, and creating analysis deliverables in Tableau or other BI tools. Communicating with internal iSpot teams (including Engineering, Customer Success, and Sales) to clarify requirements, resolve technical roadblocks, manage priorities, and summarize insights from analysis.  Query from large, complex data sets (using a combination of SQL and Python) to get data that is most relevant for analysis related to TV advertisement measurement. Be proficient in knowing how to join and aggregate potentially large data sets to make sense and provide valuable insight. Be curious about results and have a desire to understand how the data tells a story.  Create visualizations and/or tables that organize data in a way that is digestible and makes sense based on the request. Leverage Tableau or other BI tools (Excel, Qlik, etc) to create a customer-ready deliverable.  Work closely with data engineering and other technical experts to ask questions about data accuracy and validity. You should gain a sense for data that potentially doesn’t look right and communicate concerns whenever you see them.  Document project status, updates, roadblocks, resolutions, dependencies, and deliverables in project tracking tool (JIRA).  As part of a very collaborative engineering team, you will have access to technical experts that can help you optimize code, point you to the right data, and brainstorm about how to visualize a data set. You should be an open communicator and have a desire to participate in team discussions and help troubleshoot when you have knowledge that a team member might need.
