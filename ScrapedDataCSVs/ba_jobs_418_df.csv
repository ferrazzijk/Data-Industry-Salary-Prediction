Role Description

The role of a Business Analyst is to understand complex client needs. This includes creating a shared understanding of the stated business problems and opportunities at the center of an initiative or program, as well as the solution proposed to achieve the desired business outcome. The Business Analyst’s primary objective is to elicit, analyze, and document the requirements of a project, program, or product, as well as communicate them clearly to stakeholders and manage requirement changes as necessary to maximize the value of the solution being delivered within existing constraints. Requirements are typically elicited and analyzed by conducting interviews and facilitating workshops with existing business stakeholders and by closely collaborating with the technical delivery teams and customers or end users.

The Business Analyst should understand current and future processes, data, and systems to detail the consequences of making a business change to address a specific need. Business Analysts should be able to assess and validate if a solution has fulfilled the requirements as well as the stated business benefits of the initiative, using analytics tools and metrics as needed. A Business Analyst role often includes writing user stories and acceptance criteria to populate agile backlogs in most of our technology related client work.

They will be helping with metrics for the team. Plus if they have experience with ServiceNow
About the security team: They have very aggressive regulatory commitments and a firm schedule to meet. These initial PMs & BAs we are adding to the team will be helping with their current & close out their target requirements. After interviewing with the manager, she will decide on who will be allocated to what workstream. We are eager to fill these spots so will be doing a 1 step video interview with candidates.
