Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.",bos,de

We're a small development team with extensive experience writing software for the logistics industry and we're looking for a junior data engineer based in the Chicago area to help round out our team.

Product:
We define our success in terms of positive business impact. The less code required to deliver a business capability, the better. We also aim to prove the value of our features as early as possible by defining a minimum viable product, seeing its value in production, and then iterating on that.

Design:
We are building our system using Domain Driven Design principles. If the shape of the software model closely matches the shape of the business domain, then that software model should be more readily able to bend and adapt to match the changes in that business domain.

We are also building our system utilizing CQRS and Event Sourcing design patterns in any subdomains where it is deemed valuable. CQRS may require additional work up-front to build a separate read and write model but those models are so much more clearly focused, they are a pleasure to build and maintain. As for Event Sourcing, time is a critical aspect of logistics, so events provide a very natural way to model activity in the operation of the business. Event messages also provide a way to integrate subdomains with minimal coupling.

Data Technologies:
Event sourced models are persisted using EventStore while other more traditional persistence is done using Mnesia and Postgres. Disparate legacy data sources are sanitized, filtered, and reduced as-needed by Elixir services and consuming applications. Consuming applications maintain their own bespoke schema and purpose-driven copies of legacy data. Estimation models are built in R and deployed as microservices. Ansible is used to codify and provision our infrastructure.

Despite these established choices, we still believe in using the right tool for each specific problem. If you feel a new technology will best serve the problem you're working on, the separation afforded by DDD makes it feasible for us to explore those options.

Essential Duties & Responsibilities:
Collaborate with legacy system stakeholders, domain experts, product managers, and other developers to manipulate existing data sources into purpose-driven models

Collaborate with domain experts, product managers, and other developers to refine a data model following DDD principles

Document the domain model as it evolves

Implement the domain model in Elixir services being careful to avoid unnecessary coupling

Implement unit tests and integration tests

Integrate with 3rd party APIs

Take ownership of the production release and operation of your services

Requirements:
2+ years of professional software development experience (or comparable)

Modern RDBMS experience mandatory

Elixir and ecto_sql experience strongly preferred

Familiarity with DDD principles is a huge plus

R or python experience a plus

Comfortable using a Mac and working in a Linux environment

Experience using Git

Compensation Minimum:$109,000
Compensation Maximum:$191,000
Summary:
American Family’s Data Science and Analytics Lab (DSAL) is the result of American Family Insurance’s investment in innovation. We are a passionate, diverse team looking for data science professionals who can help us re-envision insurance in light of technical, societal, and consumer changes. DSAL uses advanced analytical techniques – machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and statistics – with new sources of data to create new products, services, and means of engaging customers, and to develop fundamentally new business models for insurance.


While we are part of a Fortune 500 company, we operate more like a startup than a large corporate entity. Our small, agile team is a diverse mix of computer scientists, data engineers, developers, statisticians, and insurance domain experts. We tackle a variety of insurance-related analytical questions, but ultimately our focus is on creating a new future for insurance that incorporates the explosion of new data sources becoming available from web, mobile, IoT, and beyond.

Job Description:
We look for software engineers with a breadth of experience, an appetite for learning, and a willingness to collaborate. Our team is entirely cloud based (historically AWS, but we’re using GCP more and more). We take CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and general automation seriously. Everyone codes.
Our stack for day-to-day development and operations tooling, while continually evolving, looks something like: GitLab, Python, AWS/GCP, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Datadog, and Slack. Projects have and can range from machine and deep learning model deployment, to large batch processing, to IoT and other data stream processing, to venture capital analysis of technology firms, and much more.
Ideal candidates should have significant experience and understanding of:
A major general purpose language (Python, Java, C++, etc), but Python is our preferred/primary language.
The Cloud - AWS, GCP, or Azure. Historically we've used AWS as our primary cloud platform, but we're transitioning to GCP.
CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code.
Containerization - both building and deployment.
Data wrangling and pipelining - ingesting and structuring data. This includes timely, adhoc wrangling during early stages and formal, large scale engineering during maturation stages.
Building APIs - mainly RESTful HTTP, but also GRPC. Experience w/ UIs helpful, but not necessary.
Education and Licenses
Bachelor’s degree in computer science or related field, or equivalent combination of education and experience.
Specialized Knowledge & Skills Requirements
Demonstrated experience providing customer-driven solutions, support or service.
Travel Requirements
This position requires travel up to 10% of the time
Additional Job Information:
There are multiple openings.
Depending on qualifications, candidates may be considered at different levels.
The teams are based in Chicago, IL and Madison, WI so those locations are preferable; however, we are open to remote employees in the United States.
Offer to selected candidate will be made contingent on the results of applicable background checks.
Offer to selected candidate is contingent on signing a non-disclosure agreement for proprietary information, trade secrets, and inventions.

Brace is a team of passionate technologists, mortgage servicing experts, and entrepreneurs who are rethinking the mortgage service experience by putting the customer's experience first.

We are bi-coastal with the customer and business operations located in LA and the engineering team in NYC.

While we are fundamentally a technology company focused on financial services, we are and will always be a start-up at heart and will never lose the entrepreneurial spirit that entails. The human element of what we're doing here is never lost on any one of us, regardless of role, and the impact we can have to help people is at the core of our belief system.

One of the core tenants to Brace's values is ensuring we build this company on a foundation of inclusiveness and diversity. We truly are an Equal Opportunity Employer and evaluate applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetics or any other basis - our focus is on experience and the candidate's drive to grow with us and absolutely nothing else.

What We're Doing

Our first product to market is focused on the highly complex delinquency space and figuring out how we can provide a frictionless experience for both the borrowers having trouble paying their mortgage and the servicers managing the process. We are taking a truly holistic approach by building a platform that enables mortgage servicers to react promptly to delinquency events and quickly determine the best available outcome for all participants involved. What separates us from the rest is that we are doing this with a beautiful, easy-to-use omnichannel user experience that sits on top of a host of best-in-breed technologies.

Where We're Going

At the risk of sounding cliché, we truly are disruptors. We aim to change what has become the status quo in an industry that has not seen innovation in over 40 years.

Our goal is to build a comprehensive suite of tools that make people's lives easier with a lean team of folks all striving to succeed.

vRTX software engineers must have exceptional software development abilities, and a desire to learn and work with different technologies in a short period of time. Projects may pivot more frequently than roadmap products, and intensive customer interactions can put a high premium on rapid prototyping skills. The ability to work effectively with customer engineering teams on POCs is important. Teams are usually small, so versatility and teamwork are essential.
For the envisioned project, the ideal candidate will be knowledgeable about (and better still a contributor to) the state of the art in storage systems, embedded key-value stores, OLTP, OLAP, and interactions between key-value stores and database systems higher in the stack. SaaS experience is desirable. Distributed systems expertise is also desirable.
Role and Responsibilities
You will be contributing to architecture, design, and implementation of software project based on emerging research ideas in the area of key-value stores. These will initially be dynamic, evolving prototypes and MVPs
You will assist with debugging and verification of defects in your own and others' work
You may participate in customer meetings to understand use cases and requirements
You may participate in advanced development activities within VMware or in universities to advance the state of the art
You may participate in POCs and customer interactions together with our customer engineering teams.
Required Skills
Expertise in the project-specific technical areas including storage systems, key-value databases, and the integration of these components in modern big data ingest and processing pipelines
Production-level coding experience in C
Experience and demonstrated success in advanced development and/or research project implementation
Experience engineering systems for high concurrency and many-core scaling
Experience with modern storage-related data structures and algorithms
Preferred Skills
Experience with emerging technologies related to storage, such as pmem and NVMe
Experience creating SaaS database or data processing systems
Experience benchmarking and optimizing data systems
Exposure to multiple programming languages is important, as the ability to pick up and use the language that suits a body of work is expected
Experience in a range of system programming languages beyond C
Education
Master’s (preferred) or bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with comparable work experience.
PhD in a relevant specialty would be a positive credential.
