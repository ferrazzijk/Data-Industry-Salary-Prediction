Cogo Labs Leadership Principles1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders- electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters - to contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.

This program is an onboarding of 6 candidates into 6 business units. Our recruitment of candidates is rigorous and thorough.

At the completion of the rotation cycles, candidates will be assigned a specific independent project and then finally to a specific business unit.
For the first four months, candidates will be assigned a group mentor from People and Learning team who they will meet with twice a week, once as a group and once in a one on one session. They will be closely monitored for any open issues or concerns. Assessments from training will be reviewed as will feedback from respective consulting managers. Periodic team events will be held such as lunches and visits (virtual for now) to client sites. At least one meeting will be arranged with all six consulting managers, practice directors and candidates. At the end of this phase, First Years will be assigned their permanent placement.
This role is currently designed as a hybrid work model, that is, both in office and remote.

 Locations:

 Remote Canada, Remote US, San Francisco OfficeWe’re looking for a passionate, driven, and experienced data analyst to work with our Analytics team.

At Pocket, we are focused on connecting people to the power, possibility & magic of the web. Our apps and platform are essential ways that over 100M people discover and consume content on the web.

With millions of people discovering and consuming content across the Pocket platform, our community generates one of the most unique and interesting sets of data on the web. Furthermore, Pocket’s small size will allow you to work on diverse analysis instead of being limited to supporting any one business group.

We're a small team that has the resources of a large company (Pocket was acquired by Mozilla in 2017) and that means lots of opportunity to own projects from start to finish that have tremendous impact on hundreds of millions of users, across many different devices and platforms.

If you are interested in applying your data analysis skills to help Pocket's product, business, and engineering teams make timely, data-driven decisions, then Pocket might be the place for you!

What you’ll do:


Explore and research data relating to key product and business metrics
Collaborate with product, business, and engineering teams across Pocket to support their data needs and refine their understanding of it
Conceptualize, build, and maintain dashboards and reports focusing on key metrics and experiments
Create simple and elegant data visualizations designed to communicate insights clearly

What you already have:


BA/BS in a quantitative field
2+ years of experience in data analysis or statistics; product analytics preferred
Can demonstrate advanced SQL knowledge and are comfortable wrangling large data sets into easy to comprehend analysis and visualizations
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Mode Analytics/Looker)
Enjoy communicating insights concisely, accurately, and meaningfully to a diverse audience
Have a passion for helping anyone and everyone understand complex topics
Any Python/R/Snowflake experience considered a plus
Any dbt experience considered a big plus!
Our team requires skills in a variety of domains. You should ideally have experience with some of the areas listed above, and be passionate about learning new things

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications we still encourage you to apply!

What’s the team like?

We’re a remote-friendly team headquartered in San Francisco, with more than half of our colleagues working from home, co-working spaces, or Mozilla offices. Video conferencing, Slack chats, and shared documents keep everyone in the loop and make sure no one feels isolated. We value transparency and collaboration from the CEO on down.

At Pocket (a subsidiary of Mozilla), we are a small agile team, which means each teammate has the opportunity to make a big impact. But we also keep it real: our working hours are flexible—not just because we have team members in different time zones—but because we know you have a life outside the office, and we value that. You’re human, we’re human, and everyone at Pocket is treated with utmost respect.

About Mozilla

Mozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe that open and free is better than closed and controlled. When you work at Mozilla, you give yourself a chance to make a difference in the lives of Web users everywhere. And you give us a chance to make a difference in your life every single day. Join us to work on the Web as the platform and help create more opportunity and innovation for everyone online.

Commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging

Mozilla understands that valuing diverse creative practices and forms of knowledge are crucial to and enrich the company’s core mission. We encourage applications from everyone, including members of all equity-seeking communities, such as (but certainly not limited to) women, racialized and Indigenous persons, persons with disabilities, persons of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions.

We will ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment, as appropriate. Please contact us at recruiting@mozilla.com to request an accommodation.
