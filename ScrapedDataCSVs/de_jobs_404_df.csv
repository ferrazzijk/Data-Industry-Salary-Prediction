Transport Mechanisms: Protobuf, Avro, HTTP Rest/JSON

CI/CD: Jenkins, CodePipeline, GitHub, ArtifactoryWhy Join DISCO's Product Delivery TeamWe intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:


We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.
We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we're going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.
At DISCO respect isn't earned it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.
Over the next 4 years, we'll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way.
We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

If you want to win while getting better than you've ever been, come to DISCO.
About DISCODISCO is a recognized leader in legal technology. Founded in 2013, DISCO's mission is to create great technology to modernize the practice of law. Our solutions apply artificial intelligence and cloud computing to help lawyers and legal teams improve legal outcomes for their clients. Corporate legal departments, law firms, and government agencies around the world use DISCO for ediscovery, case management, compliance, disputes, and investigations.

DISCO recently raised $100 million, for a total of $235 million in venture capital. The company's valuation is $785 million -- a demonstration of investor confidence in legaltech as a category of enterprise cloud computing, and a validation that DISCO is disrupting the broader cloud computing industry. We are using our investment to enhance our cloud technology platform and AI-powered products and services, and to continue to expand our presence outside of North America.

The primary focus of the technical development effort will be to improve our ETL design patterns and enable new ways to ingest data. Your work will include presenting your own pull requests and reviewing others. In partnership with Product and Technical Program Management you'll hold yourself accountable to the dates that you committed to, completing feature work in your first sprint.Documentation: To ease future teammate onboarding, debugging, and knowledge sharing of complex services while mitigating the risk of tribal knowledge, within 30 days in seat, you'll contribute to our established information architecture within Confluence and put a plan in place to realize 100% documentation of the systems you own.Monitoring System Health: By day 90, you will be contributing to the implementation of metrics tracking and alerting for mission critical ETL and relevant applications that power data warehouse, application backends and outbound integrations with sweetgreen partners.
