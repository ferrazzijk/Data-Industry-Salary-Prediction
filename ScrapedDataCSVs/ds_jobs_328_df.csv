What does a career at Silent Eight look like?

A career at Silent Eight enables you to work alongside a talented team of experts from around the world. We are not new to remote work-life, in fact we’ve been doing it since 2013. This means we understand some of the common pain-points of working remotely and strive to make sure you get both the benefits of remote work life, like autonomy, flexibility, and balance. But you never feel alone or unsupported.

We encourage both individuality and collaboration and want to create an atmosphere for your voice to shine. In practice, this means regular “tea time” (or coffee, if you prefer :) ), with your colleagues, monthly company calls; idea and brainstorm sessions; internal “hackathons”, and more.

You are signing on for a true taste of life at a startup and all the fast-paced, quick-thinking, and excitement that the world of technology entails.

As a member of our team, you will not only be supported in your immediate role/department, but you will have a chance to work across borders, languages, and cultures and contribute to our collective mission: to use cutting edge AI to make the world a safer place.

What are some of the benefits?


You will be on the ground floor of technological innovation, using AI and the newest technology stack to solve for global problems.
An often underplayed “perk” of remote work is autonomy. At Silent Eight we see this as a benefit because it fosters ownership and the ability to care out something that is distinctly yours. We celebrate autonomy and encourage new ideas, and we want you to share yours!
You will contribute to weekly/bi-weekly ideation sharing sessions, as well as participate in ongoing requests for input and feedback. We have a culture of openness and willingness to change when things aren’t working.
Because learning never ends, we encourage each of our employees to take a day to learn or try something new. Take an Annual Development day, on us!
Your work will have an actual impact on how the biggest banks around the world stop money laundering and terrorism financing activities. But more than just banks, you will play a part in fighting the human cost of financial crime, a cause that is at the core of our mission and beliefs.
Take part in regular get-togethers, including seasonal parties, international meetings. Even with COVID, we gather for regular video gatherings just for fun :) And we love memes, especially dog ones.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

JOB DESCRIPTION
LIFE AT IMC AS DATA ENGINEERWHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO

IMC is a leading global market maker, using algorithmic trading and advanced technology to buy and sell securities on multiple trading venues worldwide. We provide liquidity to the financial markets, driving efficiencies for buyers and sellers.

Founded in 1989, we are an ambitious, innovative company and identified early on the importance technology would play in the fast-paced evolution of trading. This entrepreneurial spirit still drives us today and can be found in all of our offices around the world.

OUR TEAM

We now operate globally from offices in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Our employees work closely together in multidisciplinary teams, making our success possible.

Technology - At IMC, technology is not a department, it is at the heart of everything we do. Our technologists push the limits of possibility, and then look beyond. In our fast-paced environment, short feedback loops mean projects worked on in the morning can enter production the next day.

Trading – Although our traders come from many backgrounds they all have one thing in common: they are at their best solving complex problems. Their insight into global events, market shifts and pricing ensure we are trading in the right place, at the right time.

Business Support - Around the world, IMC’s business support teams are essential for sustaining our success. In our dynamic environment, we have many exciting challenges and multidisciplinary opportunities to shape our operations and make a real impact.

OUR CULTURE

Our employees are our greatest asset so we give them lots of responsibility and the support they need to make a difference. Our flat structure fosters a culture of openness and collaboration, encouraging the sharing of ideas and knowledge. It makes no difference if you have been with us for three days or three years, the best idea wins.

While we work hard, we also have a lot of fun; whether solving complex challenges or in team building, leisure and sporting activities. IMC also enables its employees to contribute towards a better society through our foundation.

As a data engineer at IMC, you’ll build and administer data workflows in an evolving, modern big data-based environment.

You’ll also:

Develop and extend in-house data toolkits based in Python and Java.
Build data pipelines using common big data tools: Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, AWS.
Consult with traders and developers on data solutions: assist in identifying solutions which match their problem space and harmonize with our internal data platform.
Improve the performance of financial analytics platforms built around the big data ecosystem.

WHAT MAKES IT FUN?

IMC is on the cutting edge of financial applications of big data, processing terabytes of data daily for mission critical trading systems.
We operate at the bleeding edge of technology. If something new can bring an advantage we will adopt and incorporate the new technology.
The landscape is always changing, creating new and exciting challenges. What we focus on today is very different from what we focused on two years ago.
We really believe in sharing knowledge and technology between the different offices. Much of our technology stack is shared globally between our offices, and we provide opportunities to travel between the regions both for personal growth and to assist where it has the biggest impact.
Working at IMC is a great way to gain exposure to and learn about financial markets and technology. We know from experience that a lot of people really enjoy learning about a field beyond their immediate area of expertise, it’s one of the things that makes this job more interesting than others.
We employ a broad range of people with varying backgrounds. What they have in common is their superior technical expertise, their extraordinary smarts and their collaborative approach.

WHO YOU ARE:

3+ years of experience working with Hadoop, Spark, and SQL
2+ years of experience developing streaming data applications using Kafka
Strong Java, SQL, and Python development skills
Experience with common data-science toolkits, especially python-based
Strong statistical analysis skills
Demonstrated ability to troubleshoot and conduct root-cause analysis
Unix scripting experience (bash, tcsh, zsh, python, etc)
Experience with DevOps tools such as TeamCity, Gerrit, JIRA
Experience with running code in containerized environments is a plus, especially Docker and Kubernetes
User-focused: driven to deliver a usable product to users, rather than by technology itself

Revantage provides a highly skilled employee base, best-in-class processes, and state-of-the-art technology to multiple Blackstone real estate portfolio companies. Sectors include Hospitality, Industrial, Multi-Family, Office, Retail, Senior Housing, and Manufactured Homes.Revantage, headquartered in Chicago, is one of three global offices that includes Revantage Asia and Revantage Europe.What We Value: Our CultureCreating a culture that inspires change and momentum require the right team. We know what it takes to lead an industry, and are looking for leaders who seek constant growth, want to excel, and continuously improve upon themselves and the industry. The culture at Revantage is built on our shared core values and commitment to be:Achievers – We expect high standards for ourselves and enable the success of our teams.Enthusiasts - We face challenges with optimism and believe anything is possible.Leaders - We commit to continuously improve our performance.Learners – We learn from our challenges and successes.Partners - We deliver value and positive impact to our partners.Why This Role Is ValuableAt Revantage Data Science, we answer questions most others could not even hope to ask.If you have ever enjoyed or considered applying data science to understand the giant, tangled world of real estate – the world’s largest asset class – consider this: there is almost nowhere else you could work where you would have access to a greater depth and variety of private data used every day to drive decisions. The global, cross-asset, constantly growing scope of Blackstone’s real estate portfolio means endless opportunity for impact at scale.Different portfolio companies are in different stages of their data journey, and while all of them understand that data science is valuable, not all of them know how specifically it could help them.Thus, bookending the “data science” itself, you will be responsible for communicating with stakeholders, deeply understanding their business problems, and creatively determining how to solve those problems with data science.

Quantifind is a data science technology company whose AI platform uncovers signals of risk across disparate and unstructured text sources. In financial crimes risk management, Quantifind's solution uniquely combines internal financial institution data with public domain data to assess risk in the context of Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Fraud Risk Management, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. Today these compliance processes are burdened by ever-increasing regulatory responsibilities and an expectation of frictionless transactions. Legacy technologies demand increasingly more human resources as the operations expand; Quantifind's solution offers a way to cut through the inefficiency and enhance effectiveness simultaneously.

We extend our reach to 4000 stores across US for testing and deploying sophisticated models of all kinds for every facet or step during the retail supply chain lifecycle. The sophistication afforded by machine learning algorithms allows for more segmentation, which allows for more detailed and descriptive insights. In attempting this, we are also reshaping the attitude of the business towards adopting and trusting AI to be most impactful based on the amount of historical data and investment required.

There is a wide gamut of challenges and the obstacles are numerous to shift the thinking between solving for customers needs in physical stores versus e-commerce. The challenge of employing ML techniques in retail at such a wide scale, across varied categories of items, presents a great opportunity for creative solutions. The Merch Tech Data Science team tackles this task and its problems at multiple fronts.

Machine learning algorithms can tell a more complete story to identify anomalies and pinpoint each step of the process along the supply chain. Human bias and guesswork is eliminated, and this is applicable for any stage, be it warehouse processing or vendor management. We work on building stable automated pipelines to take care of these issues.
