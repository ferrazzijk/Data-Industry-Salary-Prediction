About the Great Oaks Foundation

The Great Oaks (GO) Foundation is a non-profit organization that brings its model of high dosage tutoring to schools from Maryland to Connecticut with the mission of preparing students for college success. The tutoring is provided by the Great Oaks Fellows, which is a selective cadre of recent college graduates who deliver at least two hours of individualized instruction to every student every day. This is a crucial strategy in Great Oaks schools to improve achievement and prepare teachers to work in our schools.

The Great Oaks Foundation has successfully replicated this program in Newark, NJ; Bridgeport, CT; New York, NY and Wilmington, DE. Additionally, we have begun partnering our Fellow program with several non-Great Oaks schools where we have begun sitting residents as well. A select group of the Fellows are enrolled in a Teacher Residency program that is being conducted in partnership with NYU's Online Teacher Residency Program and Relay Graduate School of Education.

As Great Oaks prepares for expansion, we have continued to refine both our school and high-dosage tutoring model for greater impact. Key components of this process include designing the Great Oaks High school and refining the Fellowship model.

The Great Oaks (GO) Foundation is a non-profit organization with the mission of launching and supporting a network of 6-12th grade charter schools that prepare students for postsecondary success through high-dosage tutoring coupled with outstanding classroom instruction. By design, GO's schools contribute to the vitality of the urban neighborhoods where they are located by attracting and creating social, human, and investment capital.

The mission of the Great Oaks Charter Schools is to provide students with multiple pathways to postsecondary success in the career of their choosing. At Great Oaks, we are committed to providing a rigorous academic program, fostering a positive school culture and building authentic relationships with families. We are seeking hard-working, tenacious people who share the belief that all students deserve a high-quality education. What sets Great Oaks schools apart from other college preparatory charter schools is a high-dosage tutoring model provided by the Great Oaks Fellows, a selective cadre of recent college graduates who tutor and mentor every student in the school. In partnership with AmeriCorps, Great oaks has successfully partnered and replicated our model across school sites in New York City; Newark, NJ; Bridgeport, CT; Baltimore, MD; and Wilmington, DE.
