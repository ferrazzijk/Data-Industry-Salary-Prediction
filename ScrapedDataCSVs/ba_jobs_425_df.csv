What are we looking for?
A unique Business Forecasting & Planning Analyst to join our US team, who will build models and run projects/analyses that will drive operational and strategic decisions for Babylon’s clinical operations across the globe.

This is an exciting opportunity to join a newly-growing part of our Global Operations Analytics Team, which is a global network of Forecasting & Planning Analysts, Data Scientists and Operations Analysts working together to develop long-term operational business planning models.

Analysing historical and external data
Working with operations, commercial and marketing teams to derive key modelling assumptions in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment

Inform early-stage operational planning decisions regarding clinician, clinic and support capacity

Form strong feedback loops with Commercial, Marketing and Product teams to ensure that the latest growth initiatives and tech developments are factored into the forecasting
Assist with strategy and planning projects for Global Operations in order to optimise the cost and quality of Babylon’s services
Who fits the role?
Experience in a consulting, investment banking or business analyst role, with significant experience in operational/financial modelling or planning analysis
Experience building forecasting or supply/demand models and deriving modelling assumptions in a highly-ambiguous environment
Strong analytical mindset
Experience building analyses to tight timelines and embedding these into operations to inform real-time business decisions
Exceptional presentation and spreadsheet skills
Experience working in a multi-functional role, with stakeholders across various disciplines and at different levelsExperience managing long-term projects across multiple functions or regions
Numerical degree: Maths, Engineering, Science, Computer Science, Finance or related subjects
You need to want to make a change now – this is less about creating an incredible strategy that will be implemented over the next 5 years, and more about processes that can change the business in the next 6 months.
Strong work ethic
Ability to take initiative in a constantly-changing work environment and adopt a generalist do-what-it-takes mindset.
Strong interpersonal skills and ability to work in a non-hierarchical manner across multiple teams
What's nice to have
Experience in SQL, R and/or Python

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.

We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.

Supports EDS Data Masking technical team using strong business analysis and verbal/written communication skills. Coordinates and facilitates virtual meetings between information security subject matter experts and lines of business (LOB), while accurately documenting technical details and decisions. Distributes, organizes, and manages all documentation related to engagements.
Requires a high degree of collaboration, coordination, and organizational skills.

Looking for dynamic candidates who are comfortable presenting to groups, managing conflict, and researching questions, while dealing with unexpected challenges along the way.
This person must have a really good handle on PC skills with Microsoft Office suite. We do a lot of screen sharing with various groups – this person cannot be struggling with general typing and usage of MS Office during these screen sharing sessions. S/he should be comfortable moving around and formatting in Excel and MS Word. Some knowledge of Pivot Tables is helpful, doesn’t need to be an expert. No SQL querying, but VLOOKUP knowledge is helpful because we do create drop downs in Excel - again, nothing crazy or extensive. Will be typing a lot. MUST be able to take REALLY GOOD notes. Our team has a lot of side conversations over IM while we are on screen-share conference calls, so ability to multi-task and navigate this type of scenario is needed. In addition, access to a headset and an additional monitor for dual screen is required for successful candidates. They recently started to work with Jira and are ramping up usage here.

3. Domain experience within the data space. This person will be interfacing with application and data masking teams across the enterprise as they work to mask data coming from each application as it is migrated into the newly built data lake.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

WHAT WE DO

Our consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.

We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a core set of service areas:

Agile Transformation and Delivery Analytics and Business Intelligence Business Process & Transformation Organizational Change Management Information Management & Data Governance Program & Project Leadership & Execution Strategic Planning Vendor & Technology Selection User Experience (UX)

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a ""seat at the table"" and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.
