UL Urban Crime Lab Data Scientists

About the Department

In cities across the country, people face high rates of gun violence, under-resourced schools, and social harms associated with the criminal justice system - all of which disproportionately impact people of color. These inequalities have profound consequences on public safety and opportunity. As a society we have failed to address these challenges, in part, because of our lack of understanding of the most effective and cost-effective solutions that can have a real impact on people’s lives. We believe that rigorous research can help. The University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab partner with cities and communities to use data and rigorous research to design, test, and scale programs and policies that enhance public safety, improve educational outcomes, and advance justice. Our mission is to combine world-class data science and research, in partnership with government agencies, to substantially improve the effectiveness of the public sector and achieve impact at scale.

We believe that what a brand does is more important than what it says—we want you to help brands do amazing, unprecedented, wild things, creating experiences that people never forget.

WHY YOU’LL LOVE DOING IT AT MOMENTUM

Because the idea that a brand’s action is more important than its rhetoric is the key to our entire approach. It is all about the experience and we can—hands down, bar- none—create that better than anyone else. That’s not jargon or ego—it’s truth.

Experience creates the connections that lead to loyalty, advocacy and sales. So we imagine and create those things here, in what we call the total brand experience. And how we do it is with genius, dedication, strategic thinking and working together as one fearless, handsome troop. Before you get any ideas, it’s important you know we’re serious about taking care of each other here. So think on that. We work too closely not to have fun together. We work too smart not to make the world better. And we work too well not to continually push for more. Think on all that, too.

WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR

At Momentum we believe in delivering solutions to our clients that are anchored in insights and analytics. Data Scientists are a key component of the Analytics team. From creating proprietary measurement tools, to structuring and analyzing data, implementing and interpreting models that feed business-improving insights, and putting it all together into presentations that bring the story to life for our clients; Data Scientists work closely with the rest of the team to help execute the broader vision for their account, and to continually evolve our Data Science solutions.

The ideal candidate should be intellectually curious and have an evidence-based approach to decision-making, have a definitive point of view and share it in a positive way, and get excited by a good challenge.

Produce accurate statistical analysis and ensure high quality of the data analysis produced
Interpret, document and present/communicate analytical results to multiple business disciplines, providing conclusions and recommendations.

HERE’S WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR (QUALIFICATIONS & REQUIREMENTS)

Bachelors Degree required, preferably in a STEM field, or equivalent work experience

A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric CO2 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.The easiest - if not only - way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won’t give up meat. So we need to make meat better - more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products - and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.Our world-class R&D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolution—from discovery to commercial production.

The IBM Garage was founded in 2014, to make clients successful adopting IBM Cloud – which was a new thing at the time.

Description
Here’s what all the hype is about…
Premier Nutrition Company, LLC. (PNC) distributes great-tasting food products to health-conscious consumers under the brand names Premier Protein, Dymatize, PowerBar, Supreme Protein, and Joint Juice and part of publicly traded BellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR). With its people-first culture, PNC empowers its people to create the best work of their lives alongside some truly amazing colleagues. We strive to make a workplace where you can feel like you and avoid many of the outdated processes and structure of conventional workplaces. We don’t have performance reviews—we have conversations. We don’t have command and control management—we have inspiring leaders to coach you. We don’t have a casual dress code—we simply don’t have a dress code; wear what you like. And we have a lot of fun.
PNC treats employees with respect. With its people first culture, “We are Better Together” because we bring our diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and ways of thinking to each challenge—grounded in our belief that everyone should have a seat and a voice at the table.
Bringing dogs to work, company-wide volunteer days, philanthropy and sustainability programs, in-office massages, walking meetings, and free daily exercise classes on-site and at the adjacent gym are just a few ways we make work feel less like work. And the results of our great culture speaks for itself: we were certified as a Great Place to Work™ for the fourth year running in 2020 and ranked #6 on Fortune Magazine’s 2020 Best Small & Medium Workplaces in Manufacturing & Production.
So, what’s it like to work here? You’ll walk into our Emeryville office each Monday morning and find 100 of your colleagues sitting on sofas, beanbag chairs, or the floor excitedly talking through the week ahead and watching one of their colleagues tell their personal life and career journey. Picture a casual and collaborative environment, the innovative mindset of a tech company, and the stability of a brand that sold over $950 million last year, and you’ll find us in the sweet spot where world-class culture meets robust business results. PNC seeks individuals who will thrive in this work environment and will help us build our culture and this high-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. Does this sound like you?
