Revantage provides a highly skilled employee base, best-in-class processes, and state-of-the-art technology to multiple Blackstone real estate portfolio companies. Sectors include Hospitality, Industrial, Multi-Family, Office, Retail, Senior Housing, and Manufactured Homes.Revantage, headquartered in Chicago, is one of three global offices that includes Revantage Asia and Revantage Europe.This position can be based out of Revantage’s headquarters in Chicago or New York, Dallas or Miami.What We Value: Our CultureCreating a culture that inspires change and momentum require the right team. We know what it takes to lead an industry, and are looking for leaders who seek constant growth, want to excel, and continuously improve upon themselves and the industry. The culture at Revantage is built on our shared core values and commitment to be:Achievers – We expect high standards for ourselves and enable the success of our teams.Enthusiasts - We face challenges with optimism and believe anything is possible.Leaders - We commit to continuously improve our performance.Learners – We learn from our challenges and successes.Partners - We deliver value and positive impact to our partners.Why This Role Is ValuableAt Revantage Data Science, we answer questions most others could not even hope to ask.If you have ever enjoyed or considered applying data science to understand the giant, tangled world of real estate – the world’s largest asset class – consider this: there is almost nowhere else you could work where you would have access to a greater depth and variety of private data used every day to drive decisions. The global, cross-asset, constantly growing scope of Blackstone’s real estate portfolio means endless opportunity for impact at scale.Different portfolio companies are in different stages of their data journey, and while all of them understand that data science is valuable, not all of them know how specifically it could help them.Thus, bookending the “data science” itself, you will be responsible for communicating with stakeholders, deeply understanding their business problems, and creatively determining how to solve those problems with data science. In the bigger picture, you will be responsible for helping to grow demand for data science services.You will, of course, also be responsible for performing advanced statistical/machine learning modeling and analysis across real estate market, customer (tenant), investment and other asset domains to provide insights for Blackstone and its portfolio companies.Our Team Data Science culture prioritizes care, transparency, creativity, working smarter over harder (while understanding that sometimes “harder” is necessary), iterative delivery, async-first communication, and compounding team practices that enable constant learning and make us greater than the sum of our parts (some examples: paired programming rotations, 1:1s, retrospectives, weekly open-ended discussions). Above all, we care about giving you the tools and space you need to do your best work.This role is based out of Revantage’s headquarters in Chicago, IL, though we are open to fully remote candidates. If remote, in a post-lockdown world, occasional travel to Chicago would be required.Responsibilities:How You Add ValueResearch and implement cutting-edge techniques and tools in machine learning/deep learning/artificial intelligence to make data analysis more efficient and meaningfulProvide input on new use cases, capabilities, and initiatives to inform the Data and Analytics strategic roadmap development and executionDevelop frameworks and processes to analyze unstructured information collected through internal and external data sourcesEnhance information visualization through development of dashboards and user interfacesEstablish best practices for data-based experimentation across Technology teamsLeverage current analyses and communication skills to grow demand from existing and new stakeholdersContribute actively to the culture of constant learning, experimentation, and improvement within and beyond Team Data Science.Qualifications:What You Bring To The RoleBachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Business, Economics, Accounting, Engineering or related field, or demonstrable equivalent aptitude for statistics, machine learning and programmingMinimum 3 years experience using machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis techniques (e.g. Regression, Classification, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.); experience with forecasting and time series modeling is a plusMinimum 3 years experience with various types of data repositories (e.g., data warehouses, data lakes, data marts), metadata management, dimensional modeling, and/or ETL / integration; experience with Snowflake and other cloud repositories are a plusProven ability to deliver analyses iteratively (i.e., before they are “perfect” and finished), and use said analyses to build trust and grow demand for further workProven ability to independently present to stakeholders and adjust communication style depending on the audience (e.g., knowing how deeply to describe the ML techniques utilized byProficiency in R, Python, Spark (pySpark, Spark Scala), or related languages for the application of data analyses and machine learning – we are a Python shop and Python/pySpark is a plusProficiency in one of more dialects of SQL and ability to optimize queriesProficiency in one or more visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, etc.); experience with developing point-and-click interfaces (e.g., plot.ly Dash, Streamlit, R Shiny, Javascript) is a plusExperience with DevOps practices, including the use of git repositoriesExperience analyzing real estate portfolio assets, financial statements, or other types of complexly hierarchical, “wide” data that is difficult to interpret without consulting subject matter expertsExperience in Financial Services, Hedge Funds, Private Equity, and/or Real Estate – the more of these you have, the better, but we also appreciate the perspective of data scientists from other fields if you can make the case that your experience is relevant to solving our problemsExperience with working on a cloud platform and the use of distributed tools; use of the Microsoft Azure platform (e.g., Azure-SQL, Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, Data Factory, Data Lake)Perks for YouCompetitive salary, overall compensation and 401(k)Work-life balance offerings include:Remote work policyProductivity Hours – weekly meeting-free work timeBi-weekly Summer FridaysIn-house and external learning & development opportunitiesGenerous health insurance and wellness benefitsEEO StatementOur company is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Why You Fit At Forum

 You are an owner. For you, there's no such thing as ""it's not my job."" You take pride in, and accountability for, results. No problem is too big, too small, or too outside of your scope to jump in and help.  You are a problem solver. You solve problems from first principles and ask ""Why"" until you arrive at root causes. You resist “this is how it’s always been done” thinking, and seek to solve problems in innovative ways.  You are a doer. You have a bias towards action and are able to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic work environment. You independently identify both issues and opportunities and run towards them.  You are deeply analytical. You seek out data to validate hypotheses, and are not afraid to change your mind if the data is telling a different story. You're comfortable navigating large datasets and extracting signal from the noise.  You are a truth seeker. You dig in and seek out objective truth, even it that truth is inconvenient or scary. You ask questions to challenge pre-existing views and push the boundaries on what you believe to be true.

Our mission
Aquabyte is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth.

Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect the health status, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.
Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do. We are committed to build a global, collaborative team that creates value far beyond Silicon Valley.
The role
Our product is entirely dependent on sophisticated machine learning, deep learning, and sophisticated software architectures to create value for fish farmers. As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will use machine learning to extract valuable information from visual features surfaced by deep learning models, and analyze incoming time-series data so that fish farmers make better strategic and operational decisions. Our database of labeled images is growing exponentially. You will be joining our small yet powerful research team, and will work closely alongside engineers with years of industry and academic experience.
