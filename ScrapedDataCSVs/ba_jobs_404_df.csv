Job Location: Chicago, IL

Join our team

Centric Consulting is not the typical consulting company. We live our core values and bring them with us in all we do for our clients and community. Our core purpose is simple: every day we strive to provide unmatched customer and employee experiences and foster a culture of respect, diversity, and transparency. It’s this culture, our people, and delivery that come together to make Centric a trusted advisor to local businesses.

Our Chicago business unit is part of a larger group of business and technology experts at the company, but we add a lot of individual expertise and personality to our work. We care about positively influencing the people around us. To help accomplish this, we connect local leaders and encourage knowledge sharing. We’re looking for a Business Analyst to join our growing team.

In this role, you will:

Work with business subject matter experts and technical teams to gather project needs and translate them into functional and technical documentation.
Act as a general liaison between business and technical teams.
Create reference manuals, training material, and other technical documents as necessary.
Assist in the training of new users for the solution.
Work with test teams to enable the creation of test scenarios and plans.
Coordinate user acceptance testing with users.
Work with implementation teams to analyze and triage defects.
Work on agile projects (so, it’s a plus if you have experience writing user stories, creating acceptance criteria, stand-ups, product review sessions, backlog grooming meetings, retrospectives, sprint planning processes, and of automated testing processes).

A successful candidate will have the following characteristics:

At least 10+ years professional experience within a BA function
Previous top-tier management consulting experience (preferred)
Ability to lead client engagements and build stakeholder relationships and expectations
Ability to create unmatched experiences, for both clients and employees, is what we do. You should revel in doing the unexpected and extraordinary for others.
A learning mindset, ready to experience new ideas and situations regularly.
Consulting experience is strongly preferred. That said, you will also be considered if you have a strong industry background. We like to work in the communities we live in.
We want someone who likes to solve problems. Clients don’t come to us when the problem is easy. You should enjoy taking on the hard stuff.
And because we work with clients, excellent communication skills are important – both written and verbal. Translating technical concepts into layman’s terms is an essential skill.
Initiative is important. We don’t hand hold – you should be comfortable working independently in an entrepreneurial environment. That said, collaboration is equally important. Our Chicago team and other [technologists or consultants] at Centric will give you an amazing support system. You will lean on them daily.

What makes Centric different?

Special Culture – Our people make us different. We have highly talented, intelligent individuals across a broad variety of disciplines – who are eager to learn from you and share their own expertise. We embrace fresh perspectives and each other. Don’t take our word for it – check us out on Glassdoor, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to get a glimpse inside what makes us different.
Growth opportunities – As a mid-size firm, there is more flexibility when it comes to career paths. Figure out what you want to do and we'll help you figure out how to get there.
Impact – We think of ourselves as a big company with a small company feel – a local player with global reach that combines business, technology and industry expertise.
Unmatched Experiences – We are allowed to be ourselves here. We are encouraged to be human. It’s at the root of who we are as a firm and why we’re here.
Innovation – We value passion, determination, perseverance, and innovation. We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going.

That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products - and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.Our world-class R&D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants.
