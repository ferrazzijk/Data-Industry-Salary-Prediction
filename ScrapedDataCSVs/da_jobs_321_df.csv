The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.

IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which is cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.

IHME has an exciting opportunity for a Temporary Data Analyst on the Data Intake Team, for the COVID Research Project. The COVID Research Project’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. The data intake team extracts, processes, visualizes, and reports on various data inputs required for the global COVID-19 modeling effort. Key data types include epidemiological surveillance of cases and deaths, hospitalizations, policies for social distancing, mobility patterns, COVID testing data, mask use, and information on person-to-person contacts. The team must be quick to process new data types as they become available and relevant.

The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to key research projects through data extraction and formatting, database management, data quality management, computational support to multi-disciplinary research projects, and providing inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts are tasked with developing an understanding of analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. We are looking for an individual who is able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The role calls for dexterity in working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and quality control results, and manipulate quantitative data using coding languages such as R to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.

Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.

Responsibilities:

Research command

Become familiar with substantive areas of expertise to understand the dimensions and uses of health data and the analytic underpinnings of different research streams.
Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.
Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.

Data management and analytics

Extract data manually and, wherever possible, through code-based solutions, and format data into required templates for use in modeling efforts.
Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.
Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.
Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimation.
Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.
Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.
Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.
Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analyses.
Transform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalog and incorporate these datasets into databases. Perform quality checks.

General

Create tables, figures, and charts for presentations and publications.
Provide referencing and other support for publications and presentations.
Communicate clearly and effectively while contributing as a member of the Institute.
Work closely with other team members to assist with relevant tasks, facilitate learning new skills, and help resolve emerging problems on different projects.
Participate in overall community of the Institute, carrying out duties as required with other Institute members.
Commit to working alongside others at IHME to illuminate the health impacts of systemic racism and to working within IHME to make our organization more diverse and inclusive. See IHME’s DEI statement here: http://www.healthdata.org/get-involved/careers/dei.

Requirements:

Bachelor's Degree in social sciences, engineering, computer science or related field plus two years' related experience or equivalent combination of education and experience. A Bachelor’s degree is considered equivalent to four years’ experience.
Demonstrated success in developing code in R. Other coding languages such as Python are a plus.
Demonstrated ability in using databases with large-scale, complex datasets.
Adept diplomacy and exemplary interpersonal skills required. Must be agile at forming respectful and rewarding relationships with people with different levels of experience and expertise from a variety of cultural, linguistic, and professional settings.
Strong organizational skills and the ability to successfully manage multiple tasks and priorities to meet established and changing deadlines.
Deep interest in global health, population health, and/or ways in which quantitative research and data science can be used to create valuable global public goods.
Demonstrated self-motivation, ability to absorb detailed information, flexibility, and ability to thrive in a fast-paced, energetic, highly creative and collaborative environment.
Ability to learn new information quickly and to apply analytic skills to better understand complex information in a systematic way.
Strong quantitative aptitude.

Conditions of Employment:

You’ll help us turn the vagaries of human behavior into clear, specific, and thoroughly vetted recommendations for action. Redfin’s business model is unusual in its breadth, so even simple questions will require complex logic to find an answer. You’ll have the opportunity to wrangle that complexity into clear and direct metrics, reporting, and recommendations. You’ll work on data sets ranging from thousands to hundreds of millions of records using modern tools, and develop the skills necessary for extracting meaningful human information from them. You’ll learn how to communicate analytical insights to business stakeholders effectively, as even the most insightful analysis is useless if it isn’t understood by others.
The Role
Partner with Product, Engineering, and Real Estate Operations to analyze the health of our business, identifying and explaining sources of weakness and strength.
Apply the fundamentals of data visualization to build reports that are beautiful, clear, and compelling.
Perform targeted analyses, diving deep to answer broad questions about specific aspects of the business.
Craft and deliver presentations to stakeholders in other departments which go beyond simple reporting to provide recommendations about what the company should do in response to the facts.
Who You Are
Pursuing a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Doctorate degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research, Business Analytics, an experimental science, or a related field.
Completed coursework or other experience using SQL to aggregate data for visualization and insights.
Completed coursework or other experience with one or more of the following in a data analytics context is a plus: Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, R, Python, Postgres, Amazon Redshift.
Having excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
Possessing a curiosity that doesn’t stop at the “What?” but hungers for the “Why?” and “What if?”
What We Offer
A fully paid internship with competitive compensation.
Close mentorship by a senior analyst who will be available for both formal and informal meetings and discussions.
The opportunity to work start to finish on a meaningful analytics project, from deciding on initial data exploration approaches to writing up specific recommendations and presenting them to stakeholders.
Intern-specific company-wide events and other support to ensure a positive learning experience.
We’re excited to get to know you and hope you’re ready to give this opportunity everything you’ve got!

In furtherance of its mission to deliver the highest quality professional legal services to officials, agencies, and people of the state of Washington, the AGO covers a remarkably diverse legal landscape, including consumer protection, civil and administrative litigation, environmental law, torts, tribal law, labor law, appellate practice, criminal prosecution and employment law.

The agency is highly respected for the quality of its legal work and the professionalism and ethical standards of its staff and leadership. The AGO's dedicated team of more than 600 attorneys and 600 professional staff often cite the AGO's broad mandate, offering challenging, diverse work in the public interest as reasons to join the office - and opportunities for professional growth, along with a collegial atmosphere, as reasons to stay.

The Attorney General’s Office is recruiting for a project Violent Crime Criminal Information Analyst in the Criminal Justice Division. This Project position has been established under the authority of Chapter 41.06 RCW. It is expected to run through September 30, 2022.

This position is located in Seattle, Washington* and is represented by the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE).

The mission of the Criminal Justice Division (CRJ) is to work with and support its partners in the criminal justice community and to work towards creating safe communities. Upon request from the Governor, local law enforcement and local prosecutors, the division investigates and prosecutes criminal cases throughout the state and provides investigative and prosecutorial support to local law enforcement and prosecutors in several areas including homicide cases, sexual assaults, white-collar crime, crimes involving official misconduct or public corruption and human trafficking. CRJ has formally partnered with the Department of Revenue, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner, and the Department of Labor and Industries to assist those agencies in the investigation and prosecution of crimes committed against the State of Washington and its citizens. These cooperative efforts have resulted in recovery awards in excess of $10 million to the State. CRJ also civilly prosecutes previously convicted sexually violent predators who have served their criminal sentence and who still pose a serious threat to re-offend.

Work at IHME is ordinarily performed in an office environment, but IHME is requiring remote work under most circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this evolving situation, changes to this policy will be discussed as they occur throughout the interview process.


Office is located in Seattle, Washington. This position is eligible to work fully remote; work schedule required to overlap 50% of IHME Office hours between 8am - 6pm Pacific Time.


As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.


UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.


The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas, including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.


IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which is cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.


IHME has an exciting opportunity for a Data Specialist to join the Clinical Informatics team. The Clinical Informatics team processes inpatient, outpatient, and claims data for over 55 countries, representing 3 billion clinical encounters between 1990 and 2019. The team’s primary objective is to produce population-level rates of disease or injury by year, sex, and age for a national or subnational location for use in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and other projects. This position will work with a dynamic team of researchers and staff at all levels. The Data Specialist is expected to become specialized in data pertaining to the content area and will consult with researchers as needed to amass relevant data for analysis, presentation, and publication.

Assess and contribute to decision-making about what type of coding language and approach to use in accomplishing routine computational tasks.

Transform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalog and incorporate these datasets into databases. Perform quality checks.

Develop novel representations of data and results for senior researchers and other stakeholders.

Assess results and provide input on validity.

Create new code functions to add to a common code library to make more efficient commonly needed tasks.


General

Create tables and figures, and generate text for presentations and publications, drawing upon data and information from a multitude of sources.

Communicate clearly and effectively while contributing as a member of the Institute.

Work closely with other team members to assist with relevant tasks, facilitate learning new skills, and help resolve emerging problems on different projects.

Serve as a resource to others in explaining analytic approaches, describing data, and instructing how to implement code. Participate in and/or lead internal trainings.
