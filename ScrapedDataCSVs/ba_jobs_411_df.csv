Cogo Labs Leadership Principles1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

We have a long history of developing advanced solid-state, fiber, and diode laser technologies for the scientific and defense communities. Recently, our lasers have been key to enabling cutting-edge ladar systems that can map terrain with greater accuracy and area coverage rates, providing much needed capabilities in disaster relief efforts, such as the disaster mapping of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017. We are also creating cryogenic-laser-based illuminators for airborne sensors that can detect and track fast-moving objects with highly dynamic platform motion. Finally, we've led the laser community in developing beam-combining techniques for high-energy laser systems.

DISH is a Fortune 250 company with more than $13 billion in annual revenue that continues to redefine the communications industry. Our legacy is innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo, including reinventing ourselves.
