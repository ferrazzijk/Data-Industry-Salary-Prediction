Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset.

You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:* Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

As Data Scientist, you would play a huge role in determining how this data is leveraged and packaged. Our ideal candidate will have a solid foundation in research methods and statistics, but because were building something entirely new, youll need to apply that knowledge to answer questions that may not be neatly framed. Youll help to build APIs, perform analyses, develop user-facing products, and more.

You dont have to worry about a cold start Ranker already has the data infrastructure and talented engineering team you need to get to work immediately, and your work will be directed by a Senior Data Scientist. Our data is structured and ready for analysis, allowing you to start digging into consumer tastes and building sophisticated models that studios, brands, and marketers can use to inform data-driven decisions and campaigns.

Were already expanding beyond our growing core media business and building offshoot products in both the B2B and B2C space. Much of your work will be centered around building these products, taking Rankers IP and building it into new tools. Our current budding projects include Watchworthy, a TV recommender app, and a B2B business around psychographic insights.

Based in the heart of Los Angeles and established 10 years ago, the company is solidly profitable and has 80+ employees and growing.

What Youll Do:


Translate business requirements into research components and data requirements
Provide detailed analysis that will uncover new insights and identify new sales, marketing, and growth opportunities
Transform complex analyses into compelling, easy-to-understand case studies and user stories
Maintain and improve upon existing models and tools for internal marketing and sales teams.

What Youll Need:


Masters degree (Ph.D. preferred) in statistics, computer science, mathematics, data science, or other quantitative science (psychology, economics, physics, etc.)
2+ years of relevant work experience in statistics, data science, or machine learning (or Ph.D. in a quantitative field)
Experience and passion for applying Data Science techniques to solve consumer and business problems around pop culture and entertainment topics
The ability to interpret and communicate complex concepts clearly to non-technical team members
Experience with quantitative analysis
A solid understanding of statistics and a demonstrated ability to understand the statistical basis of crowdsourcing
Programming and scripting skills (SQL, PHP, R, Python, etc.)
Knowledge of modern (tensorflow, keras, and pytorch) machine learning algorithms (clustering, regression, classification, optimization)
Demonstrable experience in research methodology

You Will Enjoy The Role If:


You get excited about taking ownership of problems and solving them in a fast-paced and scrappy environment, working cross-functionally with both technical and non-technical people
You want a strong data infrastructure and engineering team to back you up, rather than having to start from scratch
You are output-focused and see data science as a powerful tool to get things done, rather than as an end in itself


You are a strong critical thinker with a passion for understanding complex issues and are comfortable working on ambiguous problems
Your passion and curiosity for data is infectious

About Intent HQ

Intent HQ is an exciting place to work. We are 75-people strong and growing, with offices in London, Barcelona and New York. You will have the opportunity to be part of our fast-growing North American region, and work with global leaders in the communications services industry.

Reporting directly into our President, Americas, you will have a real chance to accelerate our business growth and evolve your career to the next level.

Intent HQ's mission is to help organisations have more genuine relationships with their customers by using data and machine learning to understand them on a human level. We're a well-funded scale-up business, having raised £30m from several notable PE investors.

We've had an initial focus in the telecommunications sector, landing some of the world's leading telecommunications brands including O2 in the UK and one of the largest US brands.

Our clients typically have tens of millions of customers and billions of interaction events each day. With millions of customers, it is difficult for our clients to treat each customer as a unique human being. This is the problem we help to solve.

We developed our customer analytics platform to make it quick and simple for analysts to interact with this data, even at such enormous scale, and integrate the insights into sales, marketing and customer care teams. Our technology also helps a client's in-house Data Scientists to develop new insights quickly. One client projects $150MM incremental recognized revenue as a result of Intent HQ.

The Intent HQ platform is unique because we've focused on understanding and processing this interaction data, and because we do all of this in a privacy-safe way. It is technically difficult and specialised work. Using our hybrid-cloud-based software leaves clients free to focus on integrating powerful new insights about their customers into their business processes. ​

The Opportunity

The market opportunity

Consumers demand more relevant interactions with companies, in marketing and customer experiences. At the same time, consumers are in revolt against the data privacy abuses of the past decade, and pushing regulators to protect them.

CMO's are waking up to the value of their first-party data, and trying to adapt to the radical changes being implemented by Apple and Google. These threads are coming together as marketers move beyond talking about personalisation and big data, and start delivering personalisation with privacy at scale.

Achieving this means starting with the customer; understanding and predicting at scale what matters to each person. It requires pools of data tied to individuals and things, Human-like profiles and AI-based segments and new methods of content selection.

Intent HQ's vision

IHQ's vision is to be the ""brain"" that enables the right personalised messages across ALL media (and in time all Industries) driven by a single good profile that is as accurate as a close friend's description of the person.

This involves tackling some seriously difficult problems, right at the cutting edge of deep customer analysis. We model user interests and behaviour, and apply this insight to solve challenging customer problems at scale.

What you'll do

Work with our client team and with clients to understand their needs, and take the lead in transferring technical knowledge about Intent HQ's data science and platform.
Work closely with our team to enhance existing models and techniques in ways that drive maximum value for clients. This could include enhancing our existing data enrichment techniques and/or creating entirely new kinds of data enrichment that add value to customer profiles (feature embeddings, recommender systems, propensity models, etc).
Design and build new data applications using our platform and pipelines that help solve specific client problems.
Define metrics for assessing the quality of the data we produce, and the performance of our platform.
Implement validation frameworks and methodologies to regularly measure against these metrics.
