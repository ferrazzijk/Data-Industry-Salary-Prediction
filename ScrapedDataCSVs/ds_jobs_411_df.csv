CI/CD: Jenkins, CodePipeline, GitHub, ArtifactoryWhy Join DISCO's Product Delivery TeamWe intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:


We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.
We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we're going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.
At DISCO respect isn't earned it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.
Over the next 4 years, we'll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way.
We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

If you want to win while getting better than you've ever been, come to DISCO.

Why Join DISCO's Product Delivery Team

We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:

We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.
Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.
We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.
We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we're going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.
As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.
At DISCO respect isn't earned it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.
Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.
Over the next 4 years, we'll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way.
We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.
Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

Cogo Labs Leadership Principles1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.

Recently, carbon offsets from farmland have become a frontrunner for nature-based solutions to climate change - and for good reason. As farmland gains significant traction as a carbon sink, it is important to know how much carbon is really in the soil today - and how much there is in 2 years, 4 years, and so on.The way the industry measures soil carbon and crop nutrients today is expensive, laborious, and prone to error because it requires physical sampling campaigns.Using the first commercially viable and scalable technology to quantify carbon stocks in farmland, Cloud Agronomics can detect how much carbon is in the soil and how healthy crops are from the sky.Cloud Agronomics is on a mission to tackle the barriers that are holding back rapid adoption of sustainable food production. With experience in remote sensing, agriculture, finance, and global business operations, our team is full of leaders who are committed to providing AI-powered solutions for agriculture, technology, and the environment all in one.Through cutting-edge machine learning techniques and advanced spectroscopy, our team has built solutions that have seen a number of soil types, crop stages, and atmospheric conditions. Our two solutions, soil carbon and crop nutrient monitoring, give a scaled view of these measurements that are routinely taken on farmland. The goal is to make carbon sequestration and nutrient management on farmland easy and accessible, supporting the environment and rural communities.We are thrilled by the traction we've had to date. Our technology will be operating in the US, Canada, Brazil, and Australia in 2021 - our customers are eager to use the results from our solutions to power land-management decisions and carbon offset verification.Our team is inspired by the growth we have had - we are in multi-year contracts with the world's largest ag retailers and prominent project developers for carbon farming across two continents. Our backers include SineWave Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, and Collaborative Fund.We sincerely believe that our team is taking part in a historic shift in the way we grow food, respond to climate change, and build resilient communities around the world. We hope you join our team to make an impact on the future of food.Our CultureOur mission is to bring scale, traceability, and sustainability to the global food supply chain.Our goal is to build an innovative, diverse team that is committed to this mission and demonstrates behaviors that are consistent with our company's core values: passion, curiosity, integrity, and perseverance.
