We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

In so doing, you will make significant improvements to a core element of our business.

Propose and build innovative systems to improve expert human performance

We're excited about you because…
You have 3+ years of experience in a data science role
You have a theoretical and practical understanding of statistics and state-of-the-art causal inference techniques (particularly individual and/or heterogeneous treatment effect estimation)
You have production experience with Python
You are innovative and able to define a problem and an approach through testing & iteration, even when working with ambiguity and considering wide-ranging effects on clients and the business
You have a track record of delivering high impact projects

We are seeking a motivated person to work on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle area and model data from the Seattle Flu Study (SFS), an innovative multi-year surveillance project initiated in the fall of 2018, later expanded to include the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN). The initial study was launched to transform how infectious disease outbreaks are detected, monitored and controlled, including influenza epidemics and pandemics of respiratory viruses. Through this study, the population of the greater Seattle area has been heavily sampled for acute respiratory infections through enhanced hospital and community-based surveillance, novel direct-to-public recruitment programs, rapid diagnostic tests, 28-pathogen open-array testing, and full genomic sequencing. More than 50,000 specimens have been collected to date and have shed light on the dynamics of influenza, SARS-CoV2, RSV, and rhinoviruses, and other common viruses.


The data scientist will study the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens under different conditions of population contacts and behavior, contrasting patterns observed during the COVID19 pandemic and earlier seasons. In particular, the data scientist will quantify the relationship between transmission and contacts, study why some pathogens continue to circulate despite social distancing and evaluate whether there is positive or negative interference between different pathogens. A quantitative understanding of the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions across pathogens, their corresponding R0s and ecology, can have major implications for pandemic control.


The data scientist will use a variety of epidemiological and modeling approaches to study these questions, including time series models for surveillance time series, reproduction number estimation, and analysis of large-scale contact and mobility datasets. Experience with R, Python, or other programming language is required. Some knowledge of phylodynamics is a plus.


In addition to working with Ms. Boyle and Dr. Viboud, the data scientist will work in close collaboration with Dr. Trevor Bedford, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), and a large team of researchers involved in the Seattle Flu Study and Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network.


Specific Tasks Include:

Epidemiological Research and Data Analysis

Independently selects and applies standard epidemiological tools for analyses based on available data.

Improve processes and design of research and data analysis.

Independently identifies literature of relevance to the study and datasets of interest (e.g., indicators of population behavior and mobility)

Analyze large and complex datasets in R or Python using a variety of epidemiological and statistical approaches, including:

reproduction number estimation
regression analyses and machine learning approaches (LASSO, decision-tree)
time series models and forecasting approaches (e.g., ARIMA)
disease burden models
Wavelet analyses


Research Direction

Mentor and guide the work of junior epidemiological data scientists and graduate students.


Research Communications

Attend and contribute to weekly or biweekly lab meetings, scientific seminars, and journal clubs with the Viboud lab at the NIH and the BBI (all virtual).

Preparation of reports, articles, and presentations.

Presentation of work at lab and scientific meetings.


Funding

Identify funding opportunities. Prepare proposals for funding, and contribute data analysis and figures.


The position will work remotely because of pandemic restrictions. The data scientist will collaborate extensively with the Viboud lab at the NIH. The general lab environment is collaborative, friendly, and constructive. The data scientist will also experience the vibrant research communities of the NIH and the University of Washington. Both laboratories are highly multidisciplinary and scientifically integrated. Salary is commensurate with experience, and UW employee benefits will be provided.
