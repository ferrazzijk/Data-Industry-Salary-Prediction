Why SPINS?

When we began working from home in 2020, we were committed to keeping the healthy and active SPINS culture for our employees. Keeping the culture is high priority to us as we have continued to hire and onboard new employees even while we worked remotely. We listen to employee feedback as we plan when and how we will return to the office in the future. While we can't have some of our favorite in-office perks (plenty of snacks, onsite gym, and bike storage), we've continued to find ways to stay true to SPINS:


Virtual yoga, HIIT, and Kinstretch classes each week
Each employee is allotted 8 hours to use to volunteer with an organization of their choice.
Stay connected with other SPINS employees for a weekly PELOTON ride together

The SPINS Way

Direct – We communicate with clarity, honesty and respect in all situations and embrace opportunities to provide solution-oriented feedback.
Determined – We are committed to overcoming all obstacles to achieve results. We adapt to change, seek opportunities to learn and rapidly translate that learning into action.
Passionate – We go above and beyond to help our partners achieve their goals. We challenge assumptions and are comfortable forging new paths.
Collaborative – We leave our egos at the door, believing that working together we will produce an outcome that's greater than each individual contribution.
